# RovoTasks: Text Summarizer AI Agent

As university students, we must stay organized to handle schoolwork, extracurriculars, part-time jobs, and other responsibilities. For this, many of us rely on productivity tools like Confluence and Jira from Atlassian. As life gets busy, it’s easy to miss critical tasks, so we wanted to create a tool to solve this issue. We specifically wanted to help teams working on projects together ensure they do not miss important action items as they plan out next steps during team meetings. **RovoTasks uses is an agnetic AI tool that creates a text summary of meeting minutes supplied by the user.** In the works, the Rovo Agent will analyze meeting minutes and output the list of key tasks to the user in a user-friendly interface. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/3vMarSKv1gkRAmmTZw8woi/DubHacks-2025-Project-presentation?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=8-3&viewport=800%2C381%2C0.16&t=d8pvPButoKRWa8yQ-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=8%3A2">Click to view demo.</a>

The Atlassian workshop at <a href="https://dh25.dubhacks.co">DubHacks</a> at the Unviversity of Washington helped us understand the capabilities and get set up with the Forge platform and Rovo Agent tools. We then completed more tutorials on the Atlassian Developer site to get comfortable with the tools before creating RovoTasks using what we learned. We are greateful to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenesmal/">Eugene Smal</a> for his support in this project.
